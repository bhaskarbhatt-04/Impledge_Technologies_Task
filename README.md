# Overview
This C++ program is designed to read a list of words from a file, insert them into a trie data structure and comparing function, and then identify the longest and second-longest compound words from the list.

# Files
Task.cpp: Contains the main program logic.
Input_01.txt: Sample input file (you can replace it with your own file).
Input_02.txt: Sample input file (you can replace it with your own file).
Output_File_1.png: Sample output window of console from Input_01.txt.
Output_File_2.png: Sample output window of console from Input_02.txt.

C++ Compiler: Ensure that you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.

How to Run
Step 1: Open a terminal or command prompt.
Step 2: Navigate to the directory containing the source code.
Step 3: Compile the program using a C++ compiler. For example, using g++:

bash
Copy code
g++ Task.cpp -o Task
Run the compiled executable:

The program will process the input file and display the longest and second-longest compound words, along with the time taken to process the file.

Sample Output
Longest Compound Word: example_longest_word
Second Longest Compound Word: example_second_longest_word
Time taken to process file Input_02.txt: 123.456 milliseconds

# Important
Make sure to replace the input file path in the file_path variable within the Task.cpp file with the path to your own input file.
